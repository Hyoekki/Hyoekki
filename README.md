### 🧑‍🎓 What I'm Learning
At [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/), I'm currently developing skills in:

- **Peer-to-Peer Learning**: Collaborating with fellow students to solve complex problems and peer-review code, which deepens my understanding through teaching and feedback.
- **Problem-Solving**: Tackling coding challenges and building a strong problem-solving mindset.
- **Unix System Mastery**: Learning to navigate and utilize the Unix/Linux environment effectively for software development.
- **Project-Based Learning**: Applying concepts directly through hands-on projects, like the **libft** project, to gain practical experience in C programming and software development.
- **Code Optimization**: Writing efficient and clean code to optimize performance.
- **Debugging**: Using tools like `gdb` to step through code and identify issues, improving my understanding of program execution.

### 🔭 Current Project: **libft**

I'm currently working on **libft**, a custom implementation of key C library functions. Through this project, I'm developing and strengthening the following skills:

- **Memory Management**: Understanding how to allocate, deallocate, and manage memory efficiently in C, using functions like `malloc` and `free`.
- **Pointer Mastery**: Working with pointers to manipulate data structures and strings, which has deepened my understanding of how memory is accessed and modified in C.
- **String Manipulation**: Implementing functions like `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, and `ft_strcat`, which has honed my skills in handling and manipulating strings in low-level programming.
- **Function Writing and Optimization**: Writing efficient and reusable code that mimics functions from the C standard library, such as `ft_memset`, `ft_bzero`, `ft_memcpy`, and more.
- **Understanding C Standard Library**: Gaining a strong understanding of how and why common C library functions work, preparing me to implement custom solutions in future projects.
- **Error Handling**: Learning to handle edge cases and errors gracefully to ensure robust function performance.
