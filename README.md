👋 Hi there, I’m Janne!

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a student at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/), part of the 42 Network, where I’m diving deep into software engineering. Here, we use a peer-to-peer learning environment, tackling projects and challenges that develop our coding and problem-solving skills. 💻🚀

🛠️ Technologies and Tools

	•	**Languages:** C, Shell Scripting, ~~Python, JavaScript~~, and more as I explore and learn.
	•	**Tools & Platforms:** VSCode, Git, Linux, Makefiles, and more.
	•	**Concepts:** Algorithms, Data Structures, Networking, and Systems Programming.

🧑‍🎓 What I’m Learning

	•	At **Hive Helsinki**, I’m immersed in projects like:
	•	**Piscine Bootcamp:** A one-month intensive coding experience in C.
	•	**Software Development Projects:** Building foundations in Unix systems and software engineering.
	•	**Peer-to-Peer Learning:** Collaborating and code-reviewing with other talented students.

## 🔭 Current Project: **libft**

I'm currently working on **libft**, a custom implementation of key C library functions. Through this project, I'm developing and strengthening the following skills:

- **Memory Management**: Understanding how to allocate, deallocate, and manage memory efficiently in C, using functions like `malloc` and `free`.
- **Pointer Mastery**: Working with pointers to manipulate data structures and strings, which has deepened my understanding of how memory is accessed and modified in C.
- **String Manipulation**: Implementing functions like `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, and `ft_strcat`, which has honed my skills in handling and manipulating strings in low-level programming.
- **Function Writing and Optimization**: Writing efficient and reusable code that mimics functions from the C standard library, such as `ft_memset`, `ft_bzero`, `ft_memcpy`, and more.
- **Understanding C Standard Library**: Gaining a strong understanding of how and why common C library functions work, preparing me to implement custom solutions in future projects.
- **Error Handling**: Learning to handle edge cases and errors gracefully to ensure robust function performance.
