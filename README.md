👋 Hi there, I’m Janne!

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a student at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/), part of the 42 Network, where I’m diving deep into software engineering. Here, we use a peer-to-peer learning environment, tackling projects and challenges that develop our coding and problem-solving skills. 💻🚀

### 🛠️ Technologies and Tools
- **Languages:** 
  - **C**: My primary programming language for foundational software engineering projects.
  - **Shell Scripting**: Automating tasks and understanding the Unix environment.
  - ~~**Python**~~: A language I'm planning to learn soon.
  - ~~**JavaScript**~~: On my roadmap for future projects.
- **Tools & Platforms**:
  - **VSCode**: My go-to code editor, configured with extensions to boost productivity.
  - **Git**: Version control to manage and track changes in my code.
  - **Linux**: Mastering the command line, system commands, and file manipulation.
  - **Makefiles**: Automating build processes for efficient project compilation.
- **Concepts**:
  - **Algorithms**: Understanding sorting, searching, and optimizing solutions.
  - **Data Structures**: Working with arrays, linked lists, and more.
  - ~~**Networking**~~: Basics of how data travels across networks (future topic).
  - ~~**Systems Programming**~~: Exploring how software interacts with hardware (future topic).

### 🧑‍🎓 What I'm Learning
At [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/), I'm currently developing skills in:

- **Peer-to-Peer Learning**: Collaborating with fellow students to solve complex problems and peer-review code, which deepens my understanding through teaching and feedback.
- **Problem-Solving**: Tackling coding challenges and building a strong problem-solving mindset.
- **Unix System Mastery**: Learning to navigate and utilize the Unix/Linux environment effectively for software development.
- **Project-Based Learning**: Applying concepts directly through hands-on projects, like the **libft** project, to gain practical experience in C programming and software development.
- **Code Optimization**: Writing efficient and clean code to optimize performance.
- **Debugging**: Using tools like `gdb` to step through code and identify issues, improving my understanding of program execution.
